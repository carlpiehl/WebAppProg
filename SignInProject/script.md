This is where users can sign up for our website to buy stuff. 

*Enter 'DemoMan', 'Demo@man.biz' and 'demo'*

We made an account, our system signed us in automatically.But if we we wanted to login later we could login. 

*go to sign in (already a member)*

*Enter 'Demo@man.biz' and 'demo'*

*go to products page*

These are all our cool products. We've got a lot of good things for sale, Trench coats, titans, doritos and the ultimate next-gen gaming computer. 

*Click on said computer*

This thing is really powerful with those specs, at 50 grand it's a real steal. Top rated too. You know what I've been saving up for some time I think I'd like to buy this beast of a machine. We can add it to the cart.

*Add computer to the cart*

Wow, look at that it works. Ok let's add some more items.

And that's our website guys. Hope you enjoyed this pretty cool demo.
