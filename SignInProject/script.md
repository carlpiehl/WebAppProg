#RUN THIS IN CHRONE! (copy url into chrone)

*start at home page*

Hi guys. We made an online tech store. It's pretty cool. This is our home page. 
As you can see we've got the top 5 most popular items.

*introduce selves*

One of the new things that we added was internationalisations.

*Switch through English and French options*


*go to sign up page (not a member)*

This is where users can sign up for our website to buy stuff.

*Enter 'DemoMan', 'Demo@man.biz' and 'demo'*

We made an account, our system signed us in automatically. But if we we wanted to login later we could login. 

*go to sign in (already a member)*

*Enter 'Demo@man.biz' and 'demo'*

*go to products page*

These are all our cool products. We've got a lot of good things for sale, Trench coats, titans, doritos and the ultimate next-gen gaming computer. 

*Click on said computer*

This thing is really powerful with those specs, at 50 grand it's a real steal. Top rated too. You know what I've been saving up for some time I think I'd like to buy this beast of a machine. Lets give it a rating of 1 star. We can add it to the cart.

*Add computer to the cart*

Wow, look at that it works. Ok let's add another item.

*go into trenchcoat*

*add trenchcoat*

You can now change the amount of particular item you have in cart or remove it from the cart completely.

*click the  + and - buttons for the trenchcoat then the remove button*

You can the finish the transaction by clicking the buy button. 
This takes you through shopify to process the transaction.

*click the buy button*

Talk about the credit card information or other fields used for the transaction.

*run through the shopify transaction*

Now that we've taken you through the regular user stuff, lets take a look at the admin stuff.

*Click on the sign in button from the top menu*

You can use the same login page that you would usually use, but this time you log in with an admin account.

*Login in using admin credentials*

Once you've logged in you will automatically be sent to the admin homepage.
This page gives you the option of adding or removing products from the database.
Lets start with adding.
*Click on the add product button*

These are all the fields that need to be filled in for adding a new product.

*Fill in the feilds. Then click submit.*

Now we will take a look at removing a product.

*Click on the remove product button*

As you can see the product that we've just added in the table.
Let's remove a different product.

*Click the remove button for one of the other products that wasn't just created*

Now lets take a look at the product page again.

*Click on the product page button*

As you can see the product was removed successfully and the new product that we created is available for purchase.
That's the end of our presentation.
