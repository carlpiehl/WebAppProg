*go to products page*

These are all our cool products. We've got a lot of good things for sale, Trench coats, titans, doritos and the ultimate next-gen gaming computer.

This thing is really powerful with those specs, at 50 grand it's a real steal. Top rated too. You know what I've been saving up for some time I think I'd like to buy this beast of a machine. We can add it to the cart.

#Still a work in progress.
